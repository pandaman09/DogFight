Back in the days of Fretta you had a simple flying game. Dogfight: Arcade Assault was the name and flying an airboat was the game. Now, in the Original Dogfight, you are tasked with dodging your team flying around your head and the enemy's bullets whizzing past. With a few hours of practice, even you can shoot down a formidable opponent. Do you dare take the challenge?

[b]Current Features:[/b]
Flying airboats - Every noob's pride and joy.
Guns - They go pew pew!
Explosions - When you eventually crash into the ground or try to drown yourself, you die.
Trials - Special people get them.
Spawn editor - Who needs map compatibility when you can force it to work!
A music player - It uh... kinda works. Streamed music to the client.

[b]Planned Features:[/b]
Make everything work - there are still bugs being worked out.
Better HUD - The current one is nice but variety would be cool.
Better flight model - Ever fly a wet noodle?
More Game types - such as objective based games
Mouse aim - It's been asked why not try
