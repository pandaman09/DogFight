After downloading this zip place these files into garrysmod/gamemode/dogfight.

In order to run this gamemode you must have a MySQL server or run in singleplayer,

You're MySQL database must be named 'faintlink', if you are feeling adventurous you can change the database name in mysql.lua on the 6th line where it says 'faintlink'
To set up the tables import clients.sql, dogfight.sql and mapspawns.sql into your database.

Running the server on any map other than dfa_rsi will not work because the spawn points are currently hardcoded into the gamemode until map support is fixed.

How to create and edit spawns:
*This document is avaiable on both the github where you downloaded this gamemode and on facepunch on my post here:
http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1142441&p=44575398&viewfull=1#post44575398
-Press F1 go to settings/options and enable spawn editor (or type "df_editspawns 1" in console)
-Crash or type kill in console (and respawn as usual by clicking or pressing any key)
-You will spawn over one of the current spawn points
-Press E while looking at a current spawn to modify it's properties. The spawn point will ONLY be updated if you click the "Update Point" button. 
-To spawn a new spawn point type "df_newspawn" in console. A menu will pop-up with editable information. 
*NOTE: spawning a spawn point without a team name will cause a message to show in chat and the point will not be spawned. You cannot create a spawn point while the game is paused (in console while in singleplayer). Despite the spawn having an angle, it currently does not work.*
-On the first map all spawns will be called "Fallback Spawn". You MUST update the points to IDC/GBU/FFA for the spawns to save. If the map does not have at least one of each you may not spawn properly and will be set to a fallback spawn at 0,0,2000 OR 0,0,1500
-Each map has it's own spawns. Spawns are never overwritten by a spawn on a different map or a new one created, instead the old spawns are updated.
