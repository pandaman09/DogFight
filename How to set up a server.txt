After downloading this zip place these files into garrysmod/gamemode/dogfight.

In order to run this gamemode you must have a MySQL server or run in singleplayer,

You're MySQL database must be named 'faintlink', if you are feeling adventurous you can change the database name in mysql.lua on the 6th line where it says 'faintlink'
To set up the tables import clients.sql, dogfight.sql and mapspawns.sql into your database.

Running the server on any map other than dfa_rsi will not work because the spawn points are currently hardcoded into the gamemode until map support is fixed.
